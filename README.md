# Next.js 404 Error on Valid Route

This repository demonstrates a common Next.js routing issue where a 404 error is encountered when attempting to navigate to a page that seemingly exists.  The issue occurs because of a missing or improperly configured routing rule.  The `pages/about.js` file is present but does not render correctly, resulting in the 404.
